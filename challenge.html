<h2>Low and Slow</h2> 
<p>Posted by BGB November 15,2016</p>

<p>This week i am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide cooking,you submerged the food(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.in his book,cooking for geeks,jeff porter describes it as ultra-low poaching</p>
<br>
<p>Next month,we will be serving sous vide salmon with dil hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table contact us before November 30.</p>
